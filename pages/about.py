         " Sometimes searching the scriptures can be hard, especially when we are in the midst of trials. I built this "
         "so that when someone is feeling down, all they have to do is enter their general emotion and then they can "
         "instantly have access to verses that relate to them. This isn't a perfect app so sometimes that model will give "
         "back verses that don't line up with the prompt but for the most part it gets the verses right. Enjoy the app! üòä"

st.write("At a high level, when you input your prompt it gets sent a model that is built to recognize patterns and feeling"
         "in text. This particular model was trained on all of the standard works of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day "
         "Saints. The model will take your input and figure out what verses are most closely related to the 'feeling' that "
         "your input has. This means that it's not just matching keywords, but analyzing the deeper meaning of to get more holistic matches.")
